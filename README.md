# Strategic-Framework-for-Viable-LMHV-Supply-Chains
Research Project
The semiconductor supply chain (SSC) was heavily disrupted by global uncertainties, demand fluctuations, and structural vulnerability, during particularly the past COVID pandemic period. These challenges reinforce the importance of supplying models that are robust and viable in Low Mix High Volume (LMHV) manufacturing. This study attempts to understand and analyze the main determinants of SSC viability and resilience through Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM). Using an expert committee of industry and academic professional, ten key drivers were classified. Key enabling elements are identified â€” strategic partnerships are at the top and raw material risks, capacity constraints, and compliance fall at the bottom of the hierarchy. The structure provides a structured framework on how to address the interdependencies of supply chain risk and supports strategic planning. The results are useful for industry leaders and policymakers interested in policy measures that bolster SSC performance and continuity in the context of disruption, and particularly in its high-tech LMHV manufacturing manifestation.
